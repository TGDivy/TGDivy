## 👨‍💻 About me

My inspiration for AI stems from my deep interests in philosophy, psychology, and engineering.  One day, if we create an object with thoughts at least as real as us, we could find a lot about our purpose in life.  Until then, my purpose is to create such intelligence. Currently, I am an undergrad, and I want to explore the following subtopics of AI: natural language processing and reinforcement learning. 

I'm also love working on random but interesting projects which you can check out over here:
